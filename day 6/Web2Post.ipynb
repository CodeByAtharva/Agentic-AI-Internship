        "\n",
        "Creating high-quality social media posts around trending topics is a time-consuming process. It requires manually searching the web, filtering reliable information, understanding the context, summarizing key insights, and then rewriting the same content differently for each social media platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each platform has its own tone, structure, and audience expectations:\n",
        "- LinkedIn requires professional, thoughtful storytelling\n",
        "- Twitter/X demands short, punchy, attention-grabbing posts\n",
        "- Facebook favors casual, fun, caption-style content\n",
        "\n",
        "This repetitive workflow slows down content creation and makes it difficult to respond quickly to trending topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Web2Post** aims to automate this entire pipeline using LangChain by:\n",
        "1. Searching the web for a given topic  \n",
        "2. Generating a factual, noise-free summary as a single source of truth  \n",
        "3. Converting that summary into platform-specific social media posts  \n",
        "\n",
        "The result is a fast, consistent, and scalable way to transform web information into ready-to-publish social media content.\n",
