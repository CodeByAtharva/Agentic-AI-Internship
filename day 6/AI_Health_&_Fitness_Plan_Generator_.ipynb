        "## 📌 Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this mini project is to build an **AI-powered Health and Fitness Plan Generator** using **LangChain** and a **Large Language Model (LLM)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system takes basic user health information such as age, weight, height, activity level, diet preference, and fitness goal, and generates a **personalized health plan**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a **multi-step LangChain workflow**, the application should:\n",
        "- Generate a **meal plan** with daily calorie intake and macro breakdown (protein, carbohydrates, fats)\n",
        "- Generate a **workout plan** including warm-up, main workout, and cool-down\n",
        "- Combine both outputs into a **weekly fitness strategy** with a schedule and motivational tips\n",
        "\n",
        "The final output should be displayed clearly inside the Google Colab notebook and exported as a **structured JSON file** (and optional Markdown file) for reuse and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates the use of **LangChain orchestration**, **structured output parsing with Pydantic**, and **end-to-end AI application development** in Python.\n"
